# Personal Portfolio

## About the Project

I wanted to create an attractive and personal portfolio that is easy to engage with and also sheds light on my former background. I chose to do it with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

This portfolio aims to showcase my skills, experience, and achievements in a way that is both visually appealing and user-friendly. By leveraging modern web technologies, I have built a platform that highlights my professional journey and allows visitors to get to know me better.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop users, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive navigation that makes it easy for visitors to explore my portfolio.
